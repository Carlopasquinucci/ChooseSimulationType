The python script can be used directly with "python ChooseSimulation.py"

Requirements:
- tkinter
- pymsgbox
- os

In order to install the requirements, please, run the installRequirements.sh file as "sh installRequirements.sh"

## Windows

The python script can be used directly with "python ChooseSimulation.py" or one can run directly the .exe file.
